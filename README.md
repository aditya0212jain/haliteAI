# A Naive Bot for HaliteAI 3 Competition

This is hard coded implementation for the haliteAI 3 challenge. Strategies were coded into the bot manually. Future work is to use deep RL in this bot. With this bot I was able to reach gold league. MyBot.java contains the code for the bot. 

## Running the bot
just run the 'run_game.sh' file for the game on the terminal .
